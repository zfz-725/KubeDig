    Protect access to k8s service account token
  image: images/uc/cert-file.png
  details:
    narrative: >
      K8s mounts the service account token as part of every pod by
      default. The service account token is a credential that can be used as a
      bearer token to access k8s APIs and gain access to other k8s entities.
      Many times there are no processes in the pod that use the service account
      tokens which means in such cases the k8s service account token is an
      unused asset that can be leveraged by the attacker.
    attackscenario: >
      It's important to note that attackers often look for ways to gain access to other entities within Kubernetes clusters. One common method is to check for credential accesses, such as service account tokens, in order to perform lateral movements. For instance, in many Kubernetes attacks, once the attacker gains entry into a pod, they may attempt to use a service account token to access other entities. <br />

      Pods/Containers might get shipped with binaries which should never used in the production environments. Some of those bins might be useful in dev/staging environments but the same container image is carried forward in most cases to the production environment too. For security reasons, the devsecops team might want to disable the use of these binaries in the production environment even though the bins exists in the container. As an example, most of the container images are shipped with package management tools such as apk, apt, yum, etc. If anyone ends up using these bins in the prod env, it will increase the attack surface of the container/pod.
    attackscenario: >
      In an attack scenario, adversaries may use system tools such as fsck, ip, who, apt, and others for reconnaissance and to download additional tooling from remote servers. These tools can help them gain valuable information about the system and its vulnerabilities, allowing them to carry out further attacks. It's important to be vigilant about such activities and implement security measures to prevent such attacks from happening.<br />

  details:
    narrative: >
      Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary-controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.
    attackscenario: >
      By using this technique, attackers can successfully evade security warnings that alert users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary-controlled web servers. These servers often look like legitimate websites, and are designed to trick users into entering their login credentials, which can then be used by the attackers. It's important to be aware of this threat and take necessary precautions to prevent these attacks from happening.<br />

      Adversaries have been known to use various techniques to steal information from databases. This information can include user credentials, posts, blogs, and more. By obtaining this information, adversaries can gain access to user accounts and potentially perform a full-account takeover, which can lead to further compromise of the target system.

      Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once they’ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it.
